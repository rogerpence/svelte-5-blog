I need type safe command line utility. I'd like to specifiy an object 

const cmdLineArgs = [
	{
		name: 'outputFile',
		type: 'string',
		default: 'output.text',
        required: true,
        value: null
	},
	{
		name: 'inputFile',
		type: 'string',
        required: true,
        value: null
	},
	{
		name: 'lines',
		type: 'number',
        required: false,
        value: null
	}
];

for example test.ts is using this utility,l it would be called like: 

    node test.ts -outputFile "roger//output//details.txt" -inputFile "roger//input//details.json"

After processing the command line with that object, the values provided would be assigned to the corresponding key in that object.

In the context of Microsoft's Extended Security Updates (ESU) for Windows 10, when they refer to "individuals" or "consumers" eligible for the $30 price, they are typically defining users who meet one of the following criteria:

*   **Non-Commercial Use:** The ESU license is intended for personal use on a device that is not part of a business, organization, or enterprise network. This means your home PC, your family's laptop, etc.
*   **No Active Microsoft 365 Subscription for Business/Enterprise:** If you have a business or enterprise-level Microsoft 365 subscription (like Microsoft 365 Business Standard, Microsoft 365 E3, etc.) that would typically include Windows Pro or Enterprise licenses, you'd likely fall under commercial terms. The $30 ESU is aimed at those without such comprehensive commercial agreements.
*   **Home Users/Smallest Scale:** Essentially, it's for the everyday person using Windows 10 at home, who isn't managing a large fleet of computers or part of an organization that would typically procure software licenses through volume licensing agreements.

**Key things to understand:**

*   **Per Device, Per Year:** The $30 price is per device, per year. The ESU program lasts for three years, with the price increasing each year. So, year one is $30, year two is $60, and year three is $120.
*   **Not for Enterprises:** Larger businesses and organizations have different ESU pricing and requirements, often involving volume licensing agreements and potentially higher costs per device. The $30 option is specifically to address the needs of home users who might not want to upgrade to Windows 11 immediately but still need security updates.
*   **Activation via Microsoft Account:** For individuals, the ESU will likely be purchased and linked to their personal Microsoft account, making activation and management simpler for a single user or a few devices.

In essence, if you're a regular person using Windows 10 at home, not for a business or organization, you're the "individual" or "consumer" they're targeting with this price.

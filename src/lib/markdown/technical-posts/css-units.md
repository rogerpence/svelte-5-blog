### The `vi` Unit

-   `vi` stands for "viewport-inline size" - it's a modern CSS viewport unit
-   It represents 1% of the viewport's width (inline dimension) regardless of writing mode
-   Similar to `vw` but more flexible since it adapts to writing direction
-   1vi = 1% of viewport width in horizontal writing modes

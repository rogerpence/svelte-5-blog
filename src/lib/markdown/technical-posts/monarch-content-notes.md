ASNA Monarch content ideas

-   Monarch is more than simple source conversion
    -   This aims to make prospects ponder the broad and deep things that must be considered in an application migration. It discusses how a Monarch migration is much more than simply translating source code.
-   Which database is right your migration?
    -   This aims to make migration customers understand that in many cases it is rational to leave the application DB on the IBM i. It discusses the merits of both Monarch DB targets (IBM i and SQL Server)
-   Calculating the cost of technical debt
    -   This aims to quantify the cost of technical debt of staying on the IBM i with green-screen RPG.
-   DataGate Linear
    -   This aims to provide an answer when a prospect balks at the notion of a database runtime. It discusses the technical and licensing aspects of DataGate Linear.
-   How the Monarch Cocoon helps manage application migrations
    -   This article drills into details, with several pictures, of what and how Monarch Cocoon fits into the Monarch migration process.
-   <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Five ways Monarch is the best choice (done)</mark>
    -   This aims to provide a short, easily-read list of the competitive advantages that Monarch offers.
        -   99% of your code is migrated
        -   RPG and C#
        -   Staged Migration
        -   Database two ways
        -   Mature and proven methodology
-   Why .NET is a superb enterprise target
    -   This aims to answer how C# and .NET are superb targets for an RPG migration. This is for the prospect undecided on the target platform (ie, those giving equal or similar weight to Java, Node, and .NET)
    -   It provides reasons why .NET and C# are better for an IBM i shop than Java or Node.
-   <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Why RPG may be a strategic migration target (done)</mark>
    -   The notion of using RPG as a language target is anathema to migrating away from RPG! But it's often be a very good idea for some prospects.
    -   There is already some content on asna.com about this. This content would lean harder into why RPG could be a very good target for some prospects.
    -   This aims to provide explain how ASNA Monarch and Encore make migrating to RPG (as a first phase) a strategic possibility.
-   Codify the Monarch toolset
    -   This may be internal, but it provides a bird's eye-view of the Monarch toolset.
    -   A little article is slated for the Q4 newsletter that discusses Monarch's new docs.
    -   This will probably be in the KB section of ASNA.com. Are the docs worthy of a bigger mention?
    -   If you haven't noticed, there is a link to the new Monarch docs in the Support menu at ASNA.com.

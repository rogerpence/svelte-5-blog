## If all the toolbars go away:

-   View->Show Tools
-   View->Show Toolbar
-   View->Show Context Toolbar
-   Windows->Studio (make sure Hide Studio is not checked)

### Duplicate and move an object

Use Ctrl/Drag to copy and move, then use Ctrl/J to repeat that duplication
When you use Ctrl/Drag a dialog pops up to let specify the amount to move.

-   Be sure to check "Export text as curves." This makes for a larger image but it ensures the fonts are presented correctly.

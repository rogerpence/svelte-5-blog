## Two barrel

Create the HTML and CSS for a web page pattern that:
- uses CSS Flex to creates a single row with a left and a right column, each of which takes up approximately 50% of the wrapper.
- the container provides left and right padding and the flex gap governs the space between the two columns.
- make the pattern responsive using flex basis--avoid media or container queries.
- use CSS custom properties for the critical variables in the pattern (such as the default width of the two columns, color, background color, etc).
- use CSS nesting.
- create the HTML and CSS separately.
- assume modern browser support.

["and organizations of all sizes"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/extended-security-updates)




## Office 2016 and 2019
Furthermore, on October 14, the company will end support for Office 2016 and Office 2019 for all operating systems. In addition, Office 2021 and 2024 (as well as the LTSC versions of Office) will continue to run, but they will no longer receive support on Windows 10.

The ESU page says:

The Windows 10 Extended Security Updates (ESU) program gives customers the option to receive security updates for PCs enrolled in the program. *ESU is a paid program that provides individuals and organizations of all sizes* with the option to extend the use of Windows 10 devices past the end of support date in a more secure manner. For more information about the Windows 10 lifecycle, see the [Windows Lifecycle FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/faq/windows).

> *"ESU is a paid program that provides individuals and organizations of all sizes"* 

Individuals or organizations who elect to continue using Windows 10 after support ends on October 14, 2025, will have the option of enrolling their PCs into a paid ESU subscription. The ESU program enables PCs to continue to receive critical and important security updates through an annual subscription service after support ends. The [Microsoft Security Response Center](https://msrc.microsoft.com/) defines the [severity rating for security updates](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/security-update-severity-rating-system).

But also says...  

Extended Security Updates for organizations and businesses on Windows 10 can be purchased today through the Microsoft Volume Licensing Program, at $61 USD per device for Year One. For more information, see [When to use Windows 10 Extended Security Updates](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windows-itpro-blog/when-to-use-windows-10-extended-security-updates/4102628). The price doubles every consecutive year, for a maximum of three years. ESU is available at no additional cost for Windows 10 virtual machines in the following services:

## Paying for ESU update

- Use Windows Backup to backup to OneDrive (5gb max!)

## Notes from Google Gemini

The Microsoft Volume Licensing program provides a way for organizations to acquire licenses for Microsoft software and cloud services in bulk. It's designed to make it easier and more cost-effective for businesses, government entities, educational institutions, and non-profits to license Microsoft products.

Here's a breakdown of key aspects:

**How it Works:**

*   **Centralized Management:** Instead of buying individual boxed copies of software for each computer, organizations can manage their licenses through a centralized agreement. This simplifies deployment, tracking, and compliance.
*   **Cost Savings:** Volume licensing generally offers discounts compared to retail pricing, especially as the number of licenses increases.
*   **Flexible Options:** There are various programs designed to meet different organizational sizes, needs, and purchasing preferences.
*   **Software Assurance:** Many volume licensing agreements include "Software Assurance" as an optional or integrated benefit. This provides a range of benefits like:
    *   **New Version Rights:** Access to new software versions released during the coverage period.
    *   **Deployment Planning Services:** Expert help with planning software deployments.
    *   **24x7 Phone and Web Support:** Technical support.
    *   **Training Vouchers:** Discounts or free training for IT staff.
    *   **Home Use Program:** Allows employees to use licensed software on their home computers.
    *   **Extended Hotfix Support:** Access to non-security related hotfixes.

**Common Volume Licensing Programs:**

1.  **Open Value:**
    *   **Open Value (Company-wide):** A three-year agreement for small to midsize organizations (typically 5 to 250 PCs) that want to standardize their IT infrastructure. Payments are spread annually.
    *   **Open Value Subscription:** Similar to Open Value, but it's a subscription model. Organizations subscribe to the right to use the software and can increase or decrease licenses annually. This can be more flexible for organizations with fluctuating employee counts.

2.  **Select Plus (Being Phased Out/Replaced by MPSA):**
    *   Designed for larger organizations (250+ PCs) that want to acquire licenses and services on an as-needed basis across different departments or affiliates. It offers perpetual licenses with optional Software Assurance.

3.  **Enterprise Agreement (EA):**
    *   For large organizations (250+ users or devices) that want to license software for their entire organization for a three-year term. It offers significant discounts, predictable budgeting through annual payments, and comprehensive Software Assurance benefits. It's a "true-up" model, meaning you report your usage annually and adjust payments accordingly.

4.  **Microsoft Products and Services Agreement (MPSA):**
    *   A transactional licensing agreement for commercial, government, and academic organizations with 250 or more users or devices. It simplifies purchasing by consolidating various agreements into a single agreement. It's designed to make it easier to purchase both on-premises software and cloud services.

5.  **CSP (Cloud Solution Provider) Program:**
    *   This isn't strictly a "volume licensing program" in the traditional sense, but it's crucial for how many organizations acquire Microsoft cloud services (like Microsoft 365, Azure). Partners directly manage the customer relationship, billing, and support for Microsoft cloud services, offering more integrated solutions and support.

**Benefits of Volume Licensing:**

*   **Simplified Management:** Easier to track and manage licenses, reducing administrative overhead.
*   **Cost Efficiency:** Discounts for bulk purchases.
*   **Budget Predictability:** Annual payments in some programs help with financial planning.
*   **Flexibility:** Options to scale up or down as organizational needs change.
*   **Software Assurance Benefits:** Access to a suite of benefits that enhance software value and support.

Choosing the right volume licensing program depends on factors like the size of your organization, the number of licenses needed, your IT infrastructure, and whether you prefer perpetual licenses or subscriptions to cloud services. Many organizations work with a Microsoft licensing specialist or partner to determine the best program for their specific requirements.

Here's a visual representation of how different licensing models might cater to various organizational needs:

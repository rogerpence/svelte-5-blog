* Catch up from Rumin8 3 - February 12, 2025
	- We discussed acquiring an email list. 
	- We discussed a new campaign to our existing email list. We identified those who have DG for IBM (included those with and without maintenance) and on March 25th sent out a campaign. We found 576 unique email addresses, but after applying the "unsubscribe" rule we had 356 recipients. This eblast featured Monarch migration and ASNA Services. There were five registrants for a Monarch Webcast. Four attended, but were very quiet and didn't ask any meaningful questions. There was one registrant (mreyes@bncollege.com - Barnes and Nobel) whose registration looked promising but she didn't attend. 
	- We discussed AI and how it might help us with finding prospects--but no concrete ideas were present; nor have any been identified since. 
	- We discussed face-to-face visits with prospects (and TikTok). 
	- We discussed online cost estimator calculator is suggested as a way to generate leads by offering a quick, albeit potentially inaccurate, estimate for migration costs.  We also discussed at another meeting making our Monarch offerings more ala-carte, mostly in the effort to keep the initial costs down (ie, testing as a separate component, not included with the base migration price) 

* Coordination meeting notes
	- Windows 10 retirement	
		- Windows 10 support ended on Tuesday, October 14
		- The ASNA Newsletter also went out on Tuesday, October 14th and its lead story was Windows 10 retirement (by both MS and ASNA)
			- https://www.asna.com/en/newsletter/q3-2025
	- LakeB2B mailing list efforts
		- On Thursday, Oct 9th, we sent out an eblast to the ~2500 to whom we've previously sent an eblast plus 5000 to whom we've never sent anything. 
			- First mailing - Oct 9th
				- opens: 47% clicks: 23%
			- Second mailing - Oct 14th
				- opens: 38% clicks: 24%
		- Our open rate averages usually vary between 30%-40%, so we are on track there. However, our click rate is through the roof on this campaign. Average click rates usually vary between 2% and 3% ours is ten times that!  
		- Other campaigns have been in the 25-30% open rate and 3%-5% 
		- For comparison, the EN ASNA newsletter (sent to our list last week) had 40% opens and 30% clicks. ES had 48%/31%.
	- We'll have a follow-up email Thursday, Oct 16th, but our expectations aren't very high on that. 
	- We have ~16,000 email addresses left to send. We'll have a new campaign next week for 5000 new recipients. We'll repeat that over the next three weeks until all 16,000 have been sent. 
	- More on this topic later in the Rumin8 meeting. 
* Today's meeting
	* Mailing lists 
		* There are essentially two types of mailing list providers: Commodity list resellers and List researchers (my terms, not theirs) 
			* "Commodity list resellers" (like LakeB2B, the company from whom we purchased our list) sells mailing lists (with email addresses and contact info) and generally claim to be able to do fine-grained queries to find specific customers. For example, LakeB2B claimed it could provide a list that is exclusively shops with IBM i boxes.
			* "List researchers" don't focus on selling lists, they focus on selling research to find you a list. These business are very clear that it's not possible to buy a list today of IBM i users. To get to that level of detail they do deep research (websites, job listing, and LinkedIn, primarily) to find the target audience. 
				* The only two metrics that are generally known to worthwhile metrics are industry type and business size. Deeper digging may be available through a custom query.
			* There are many commodity list resellers within the mailing list community, it's apparently pretty well known that there are very few list wholesalers (30 or 40 years ago there were many) and that all commodity list resellers buy from the same few wholesalers. One list researching told me that market is well-known to be hyper-commoditized.
			* An engagement with "list researchers" starts at 10K per year, but quickly grows to two or three times that if it includes custom queries and cold calling services
		* When we purchased our list from Lake B2B, we discussed Constant Contact with they didn't raise any flags. However, we have since learned that Constant Contact isn't a good place from which to send cold emails. LakeB2B assured us that their email addresses are approved for sending emails, but apparently Constant Contact may not agree with that. 
		* [Instantly.ai](https://instantly.ai/pricing) -- cold email service. $1k per year for up to 7500 emails monthly or $2K per year for up to 200k per month. While Instantly has a leads database, it's apparently not rated very highly--but as a cold email service it is highly rated.

Budget
- We budgeted $30K for marketing efforts this year. 
	- We spent $9k with LakeB2B
- With the year 
	

Things to do: 
- Create what list creators call an customer profile 
- Cold calls
	- It's generally recommended that a cold email campaign have follow-up callers contact those who responded to the email (the clickers_
		- We sent a cold email to 7946 unique email addresses. 1827 recipients (23%) clicked through to our landing page. 
			- it takes 200 cold calls to get an appointment.
			- a caller averages 33-50 calls per day.
			- it takes 55 person days to call those 1827 recipients.
	- industry averages
		- 72% of cold calls do not get through
		- 90% of CEOs say they never open cold emails or accept cold calls
Ideas
- Rockwell's list has 43000 US IBM i shops on it. Do we hire cold callers to start working that list? (at 33 calls per day, that's 1300 days of calling!)
- More compelling Monarch marketing content
	- Which includes videos
	- White papers and "white sheet" collateral to send prospects 
	- Case studies

Leads this year:
- Year to date we've received 9 leads from ASNA.com
   ![[image-53.png|397x180]]
   I think every recent migration prospect has come to us from the site.
- For 2024 we received 11 leads, 2023 we received 8 leads

Questions:
- Do our migration prospects immediately associate RPG to .NET as doing what we all know it does? 
- Of these prospects/customers, has the primary driver for migrating been anything other than persisting their application into the future without RPG programmers?
	- CVS
	- SWBC
	- MTA
	- Bird Precision
	- Central Texas Iron
	- Farm Credit of Texas
	- Premier Paper
	- OSCO
	- How about the Japanese prospects we've had 
- What are biggest roadblocks to getting a prospect to move forward
	- from a phone call to a meeting
	- from a meeting to an assessment/POC
	- from a POC to a migration
- What do migration customers most need help with? 
- What are they most confused about? 
- What are they most surprised about?

What should the primary heading of our home page say?
	- What verb should we be using for what we do?
		- Modernize
		- Migrate

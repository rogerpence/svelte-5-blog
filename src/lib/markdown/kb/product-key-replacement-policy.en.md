The following new Product Key Replacement Policy goes into effect on
November 1st, 2025.

**For customers who have an active Product Maintenance support plan**

-   For generally available or retired products, replacement keys are
    available at no charge.

**For customers without an active Product Maintenance support plan**

-   For generally available products, replacement keys are available for
    a fee. The fee amount depends on the product. The fee varies based
    on the product and number of seats licensed. Email us at
    <codes@asna.com> for the fees for your products/seats.

-   For retired products, replacements keys are not available. For
    retired products, the product needs to be repurchased to acquire a
    key.

**Generally available and retired products**

-   The list of generally available products can be seen under the
    "Generally Available Products" heading on <a href="https://www.asna.com/downloads/en">this page.

-   Any products not listed under the "Generally Available Products" (as
    mentioned above) are retired products.

**Special Product Maintenance Amnesty offer available through November
1st, 2025**

Repurchasing product maintenance after a maintenance plan has lapsed is
generally not available. However, if you've let your maintenance lapse,
you can avoid needing to repurchase a product to get a maintenance plan
with our special Product Maintenance Amnesty program through November
1st, 2025.

While tech support is not available with a maintenance plan for retired
products, having that plan for retired products does ensure you are
always able to get keys at no charge.

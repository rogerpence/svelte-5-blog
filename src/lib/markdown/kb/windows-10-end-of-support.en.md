## Windows 10 end-of-support FAQ

An event as big as Windows 10 going to the big software house in the sky begs lots of questions. Let's ponder a few of them.


### Why is ASNA discontinuing support for Windows 10?

After October 14th, security updates are not available for Windows. Without those updates, we can't risk having Windows 10 on our networks. We've been very clear with our customers on our Windows 10 plans and first announced them in our 2025Q1 ASNA Newsletter.  

### What does "ASNA will no longer support Windows 10?" mean? 

Our products will quite likely continue to run properly on Windows 10 for a long time. Windows 10 is categorized as not supported because we will no longer test new product builds on Windows nor will we be able to recreate technical support issues on Windows 10. 

We haven't had a Windows version-specific issue with our products since back in the Windows XP/Windows Vista era. If you're a rogue and going to continue to use Windows 10 and need to report an issue to tech support, don't hesitate to do so. We'll do our best to recreate your issue on Windows 11. Should we find an issue, it's highly likely that the fix that works on Windows 11 will also work on Windows 10.

ASNA no longer supports Windows 10 after October 14, 2025. However, if you experience a tech support issue with any of our products and Windows 10 (and if you have a current maintenance agreement), we will do our best to recreate your issue on Windows 11. If we find an issue, chances are the solution that works on Windows 11 will also work on Windows 10.

### Will my Windows 10 PC quit working on October 14th? 

No, on October 15th your PC will boot and and continue to run everything it did the day before, including ASNA software. The difference is that after October 14th you'll be computing with a higher level of threat and risk than before. How much higher is up for debate&mdash; but the threat is definitely higher.

### Is the Microsoft Extended Security Update program for consumers any help for me?

Microsoft recently announced, for the first time ever, an Extended Security Update program for consumers (ie, using Windows for non-business purposes). That program is $30 in the US and free in Europe. It is for one year and does indeed offer a some relief for consumers. [Details on Microsoft's Windows 10 ESU program](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/extended-security-updates). 

Microsoft's Windows 10 ESU program is for consumers and doesn't affect ASNA discontinuing Windows 10 support on October 14th, 2025. 

### I'm a rogue and refuse to bow down to Microsoft and intend to use Windows 10 forever. Am I doomed? 

Let's be very clear: We think it's very important for our customers to upgrade to Windows 11 as soon as possible. While Windows 10 served us well, its time is up. 

Having said that, while Microsoft is indeed pulling the plug on Windows 10, it promises to deliver Windows Defender (Windows 10's intrinsic antivirus/malware solution) updates through 2028. ([Search this page for "defender"](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/10/31/how-to-prepare-for-windows-10-end-of-support-by-moving-to-windows-11-today/) and [see this page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-apps/end-of-support/windows-10-support)).

A diligent Windows 10 rogue who is: 

* exceedingly mindful to ignore untrusted links
* doesn't download untrusted downloads
* careful about ignoring enticing emails from cousins of recently-deceased foreign gazillionaire overlords promising to bequeath you a fortune
* open to risk and heartache

is probably not doomed in the short-term staying on Windows 10. But sooner or later, the need to upgrade will strike. You might as well do it now. After all, do you know anyone still using Windows XP?

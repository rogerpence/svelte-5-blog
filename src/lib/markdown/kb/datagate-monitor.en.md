The ASNA DataGate Monitor (DGM) is a free-standing utility that you can install on client Windows desktops and servers to create and maintain database names. It doesn’t require Visual Studio and has a very small footprint on the client machines.

DGM can also help with several aspects of using the ASNA DataGate Local Database engine. It can: 

*   Create local databases
*   Create database names (this video also digs into some detail on database names)
*   Show local database active jobs
*   Repair local databases
